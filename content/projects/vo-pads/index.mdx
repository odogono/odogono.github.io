[VO Pads](https://vo.odgn.net) is a web-based video player that lets you trigger and control video clips using a pad-based interface, keyboard, or MIDI controller.

Each of the sixteen pads on screen can be assigned either a YouTube video, or a local mp4 file.

Projects can be shared by copying a URL link, which contains the entire project data.

This means that nothing is stored on the server, it is all local to the browser.
