[VO Pads](https://vo.odgn.net) is a web-based video player that lets you trigger and control video clips using a pad-based interface, keyboard, or MIDI controller.

Each of the sixteen pads on screen can be assigned either a YouTube video, or a local mp4 file.

Once a video source is assigned to a pad, it's start time and duration can be adjusted. Further controls allow the speed and volume to be adjusted.

A pad can be set to loop, play once, or play only when the pad is held down.

Pads may be triggered by tapping with a pointer, via keyboard, or with incoming MIDI messages.

It features two types of sequencer - a step sequencer (like a drum machine) and a linear sequencer (like a traditional video editor).

Projects can be shared by copying a URL link, which contains the entire project data.




## Tech Stack

VO Pads is a fairly typical SPA - [React](https://react.dev/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).


One of my aims was to avoid any kind of server requirement. 

Because the entire state of a project can be stored in the URL, I can avoid server side databases. Collections of projects can be published to social media, or even regular html pages.

The one part where this fell down was generating the social media thumbnail for a given project. This has to be done on the server.

I began playing around with CloudFlare workers to fulfill this function, and while this worked, the free tier was a bit too limiting.

So instead, I used NextJS's ability to handle server side rendering.
