As part of my ongoing work on [Strix](/projects/strix), I've been working on a way to map GPS data to roads.

GPS data is what you get back from the Location APIs on your phone. It is a list of latitude and longitude coordinates, along with a timestamp and sometimes other bits of metadata like speed and altitude.

Accuracy isn't always guaranteed. Lots of things can affect it. As a result, the data can be somewhat noisy.

For the majority of uses, this is fine - showing an approximate path on a map is good enough. Strava and plenty of other apps do this.

But for Strix, I am very much interested in what roads have been walked on. Therefore, I undertook to figure out how do to this.

I assume this is already a well studied problem in the GIS world. But my requirements were that I needed to do this in a typescript environment. And I though it would be fun to do this myself.



## Some definitions

I'll start by defining what data I have to work with.

First of all is the GPS data. Represented in GeoJSON as a LineString - a joined list of Lon/Lat points.

Next is the road data. I source all of this from the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) project. 
Roads (or paths) are also represented as LineStrings. But they are split into segments. So that when a road meets another road, you get a junction.

You can see this in the image below. Two roads, split into segments where other roads meet.

<Image src={imageRoads} alt="road segments" width={640} height={300} fit="cover" />
<br/>
<br/>

So the function we are after is:

GPS LineString + Road data = Mapped GPS LineString




## First scenario


Let's start with an easy one. A simple road - just two points.
