Door world sits happily on the front page of my site. It is a procedurally generated world of rooms and doors. And pretty much nothing else at the moment. Although I plan to add a lot more "furniture" in future.

The only interactivity it has currently is being able to move from room to room. Not too complicated, but I am quite proud of how it animates. In this post, I am going to give an overview of how this part of the system functions - in particular, how the state and animation systems are tied together.

To give a technical overview, it is a React Three Fiber app, using Jotai for state, and React-Spring for animation.


## Animating in React

React and animation can present challenges due to React's core principle: a function transforms data into a view \(Function(Data) = View\). This paradigm works well for static UIs.
However, smooth animations necessitate directly manipulating elements without altering the underlying data.

In Door World, my data defines the geometry and properties of rooms and doors. The initial render creates a component tree analogous to a webpage, but using 3D elements like cameras, geometry, and materials instead of divs, images, and text.

Animation occurs on two levels.

To make a door appear or change colour (abruptly), I can change the Data to remove it from the React component tree, triggering a re-render.

To animate a door opening or changing color (gradually), I directly modify the properties of the corresponding component. This avoids a full React re-render - which would be bad.

In Door World, the first case is dealt with by the state management system i am using - Jotai.

The second, fine grained animation, is handled by React Spring.



## The animation

Lets break down the animation. When a door is touched, the following happens:

- the camera moves to the touched door
- the door opens
- the new room is brought into view
- the camera moves into the centre of the new room
- the opened door closes
- the old room fades out from view


This is what React (and React Three Fiber) are doing in this scenario:

- handling user interaction
- rendering the room component tree to screen
- the infrastructure to create all of this - hooks, components, etc.

This is what React Spring is handling:

- camera movement
- door opening and closing
- room transitioning in and out of view

And this is what Jotai brings to the party:

- the world definition
- where doors are positioned
- whether doors are open or shut
- how a door links from room to room
- orchestrating the animation process


## Springing Entities


Each entity (door, room, ...) is defined with the following super type:

```typescript
export interface EntityRef {
  mount: () => Promise<boolean>;
  unmount: () => Promise<boolean>;
}
```

The functions, when called, animate the entity into the scene.

In the case of a Door, it rises up from the ground when mounted, and sinks back down when unmounted.

I structured the code so that the promise only fulfills when the animation is complete.




## Atoms everywhere

Lets take a look at that last point, how Jotai orchestrates the animation.

Jotai uses an atomic approach to state management. Each atom contains a piece of data, which you can read and write to.

You can also create derived atoms - atoms which don't contain data themselves, but which can read or write to other atoms

With this approach you can create a graph of atoms, each with their own concerns.

In Door World, i have an atom called moveToRoomAtom. It contains the logic for the animation process. As well as using other atoms to retrieve or update the state of the world, it uses actions which are tied to the React-Spring animation process.

Here is an overview of the atom graph used:

<ImageModal src={imageAtoms} alt="Atoms" width={640} height={200} fit="cover" />


a description of what these atoms do:

- currentRoomAtom - stores the id of the current room
- dungeonAtom - stores the dungeon state object
- setVisibleEntitiesAtom - setter atom - updates:
- visibleRoomsAtom - an array of Room ids which are visible
- visibleDoorsAtom - an array of Door ids which are setDungeonVisibleAtom
- hasVisitedRoomAtom - a getter atom which returns whether a given roomId has been hasVisitedRoomAtom
- visitedRoomsAtom - an array of room ids which have been visited
- addVisitedRoomAtom - a setter atom which updates dungeonVisitedRoomsAtom and dungeonRoomHistoryAtom



As well as references to other atoms, the moveToRoomAtom is supplied with these callback actions:

- doorAction - takes a door id, finds the door component ref, then sets its open state
- moveCameraAction - moves the camera to a specified position
- unmountRoomAction - calls unmount on all the components in the room - doors and the room itself

each of these actions return promises which eventually trigger the React-Spring animation behaviour.


```typescript
// 1. open the door and move the camera to the door
log.debug('Opening door', { doorId });
await Promise.all([
  doorAction(doorId, true),
  moveCameraAction(door.position)
]);

// 2. update the door status
log.debug('Updating door status', { doorId });
set(dungeonAtom, dungeon => updateDungeonDoorState(dungeon, doorId, true));
```





## Wrapping up

In this article, we've explored how to create smooth, complex animations in a React Three Fiber application by combining Jotai for state management and React Spring for animations. 

The key insight is separating concerns: using React for component rendering and user interaction, React Spring for fine-grained animations, and Jotai for orchestrating the overall state and animation flow. 

This architecture allows us to maintain React's declarative nature while still achieving performant, fluid animations. 

The atomic approach of Jotai makes it easy to manage complex state relationships, while React Spring provides the tools to create natural-feeling transitions. 

Together, they create a powerful system for building interactive 3D experiences.
