[Apparently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXsId9C4zpg) the browser [Arc](https://arc.net/) is dead.

Well not dead, but [discontinued](https://www.ghacks.net/2025/05/27/arc-browser-has-been-discontinued-but-the-companys-building-a-new-browser-dia/) in favour of a new AI centric browser called Dia. I remain unconvinced.

I made Arc my primary browser a couple of months ago. 
Safari was my main for quite some time almost by default. Chrome for some tasks, Firefox mainly for dev.

What I like about Arc is the side-bar of tabs. Even if I wish I could have it [on the right rather than left](https://x.com/joshm/status/1724508113208754356). It makes in painful to use with the Mac dock when I am in laptop mode, if you must know.

Spaces are also great. I have one for Dev, another for news and socials. 


It has some annoyances. I wish that pinned tabs would revert back to their origin after a certain time. I wish there was an iOS version so I could sync. But otherwise, pretty happy.

Given that even now, there is an update waiting to apply, my perception is that it’s not quite lifeless. 

Nonetheless, I am open to options again.

Back in the day, I used to avidly follow a site called browserwatch. Which at one point would have daily updates on the latest browser advances. Now, I can’t even find an archive link to it.

It does seem like Chrome has won. I don’t think the space has stagnated completely. There are promising rumours. 

Most likely I will migrate to [Zen](https://zen-browser.app/), and hope that its Firefox core doesn’t fall too far behind.
