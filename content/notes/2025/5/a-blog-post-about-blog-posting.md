After seemingly an eternity of fiddling, i finally moved this site from [hugo](https://gohugo.io) to [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Why? Hugo is great at what it does, but one thing I found lacking was the ability to interleave interactive javascript, one thing Astro excels at.

The conversion hasn't been that straightforward. Astro is no-where near as batteries included as Hugo.

Tags? Had to roll that myself. Pagination? Not quite implemented yet, but again custom code.
